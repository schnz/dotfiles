# The modify_GoogleEarthPro.conf script changes the default locations that
# Google Earth uses to store its data. But this happens only after the config
# file was initialy created during the first startup of Google Earth. By this

# Unfortunately, Google Earth uses the configurable CachePath only for very few
# pieces of data. Map data and other large chunks are continued to be cached in
# ~/.googleearth/Cache for the time being, which is why it is ignored below.
